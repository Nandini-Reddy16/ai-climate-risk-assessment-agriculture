# AI-Based Climate Risk Assessment for Agriculture

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered system that analyzes climate trends, identifies climate-related risks, and provides assistive planning insights for agriculture.

## Problem Statement
Climate variability such as irregular rainfall and rising temperatures affects agricultural productivity. Farmers and planners need intelligent tools to interpret climate data at a local level.

## Solution
The system uses an agent-based architecture built with LangFlow and IBM Granite models to:
- Analyze climate trends
- Detect agricultural climate risks
- Provide assistive planning insights

## Key Components
- Climate Trend Analysis
- Climate Risk Detection
- Assistive Advisory System

## Technologies Used
- LangFlow
- IBM Granite LLM (Watsonx)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Search API

## Role of RAG
RAG is used to retrieve climate-smart agriculture guidelines and policy documents, grounding the AI responses in reliable external knowledge.

## Outcome
Supports climate-resilient agricultural planning and informed decision-making.

## Disclaimer
This system provides assistive insights only and does not replace expert agricultural advice.
